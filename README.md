This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks robust error handling for cases where the user ID is invalid or database errors occur. This can lead to unexpected behavior and unhelpful error messages for the client. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, returning specific HTTP status codes and more informative error messages.
